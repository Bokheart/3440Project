# Experimental Analysis of Knapsack Problem Algorithms: Dynamic Programming vs. Greedy

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides an experimental comparison of two major approaches to solving the classic **0/1 Knapsack Problem (KP)**: the exact **Dynamic Programming (DP)** algorithm and the heuristic **Greedy Algorithm**.

The core objective is to analyze algorithm performance across key metrics:
1.  **Solution Quality:** Measured by the Optimality Gap.
2.  **Computational Efficiency:** Measured by Runtime (seconds).
3.  **Resource Consumption:** Measured by Memory Usage (KB).

Our analysis focuses on how these metrics change as a function of the **Number of Items ($N$)** and the **Knapsack Capacity ($W$)**.

## ▶️ Quick Launch (Run on Binder)

Click the button below to launch the project's analysis code in a cloud-based Jupyter environment. No local installation is required.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Bokheart/3440Project/main?urlpath=file%2Fsrc%2Fplot_results.ipynb)

**Note:** If your analysis file is a Python script (`.py`), please ensure the file path in the Binder link (`urlpath=...`) is correct.

### How to Run

1.  Click the **Binder badge** above.
2.  Wait for the environment to build and launch.
3.  Once the JupyterLab interface opens, open the analysis file (e.g., `src/plot_results.ipynb`).
4.  Run all cells to automatically read the data, perform calculations, and generate all comparison charts.
